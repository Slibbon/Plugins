## What is a "one click" plugin?
A one click plugin is a menu entry swapper that swaps the menu entry after you click, but before it gets processed and sent by the client.
This way, you can be sure that you are clicking the "correct" menu entry every time.
One click plugins do not have any automation, you have to manually click for every action to happen.
