# Plugin Information

## One Click Vyres
Start either in edgeville bank or the house with a knife in it south east of the Darkmeyer teleport. Must have Drakan's medallion and construction cape or house tabs in inventory or equipped. Bank pin needs to be entered and withdraw option needs to be set to 1. House requires a jewelery box with last teleport used as Edgeville.

Plugin will stop itself if the vyre to thieve from isn't in the house or if an aggressive vyre is in the house after teleporting to safety. You will need to get it in/out of the house yourself then restart the plugin.
